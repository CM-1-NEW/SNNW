#Subspace method based on neural networks in weak form (SNNW)
Codes associated with the manuscript titled "Subspace method based on neural networks for solving the partial differential equation in weak form" authored by Pengyuan Liu Zhaodong Xu and Zhiqiang Sheng. This repository provides a modular and user-friendly implementation, developed with PyTorch 2.0.0, and designed for ease of use and modification. In this version, we provide an example for solving the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation; more examples will be provided in future versions.
