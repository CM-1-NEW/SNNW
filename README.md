## Overview
This repository provides a modular and user-friendly implementation of the SNNW method,  
developed with **PyTorch 2.0.0**, and designed for ease of use and modification.  

In this version, we provide an example for solving the **one-dimensional Helmholtz equation**.  
More examples will be included in future versions.
